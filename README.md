# Clicks Per Second (CPS) Tester

A simple and interactive web application that measures how fast a user can click within a fixed time period.
The app calculates and displays **Clicks Per Second (CPS)** in real time using JavaScript event handling and timers.

This project demonstrates working with events, timers, and dynamic UI updates.

## 🧠 How It Works

* User starts the test by clicking the button.
* A timer begins counting down.
* Each click is recorded using JavaScript event listeners.
* CPS is calculated using:

```
CPS = Total Clicks / Time (seconds)
```

* Final results are displayed after the timer ends.
